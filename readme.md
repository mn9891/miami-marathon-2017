# Predicting the Attendance for the 2017 Miami Marathon

### Mini Project 1 - Applied Machine Learning [COMP-551] - McGill - Winter 2017

This notebook is my participation in the group work for the first mini project from COMP-598 course. It aims at predicting the attendance for the 2017 Miami Marathon and it consists of data preprocessing, features engineering, balancing training classes and training naive Bayes classifier to finally generate the prediction file for the attendance. <br>
The provided dataset includes participants in the Miami marathon and their performances, for the last 15 years. It contains over 38,000 entries.
